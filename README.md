#_**Blackjack by d6ta**_
This is a simple blackjack game I created. It is
one of my first programming projects.

###_**How I made it**_
I have known about classes and the
object-oriented style of Python for a while,
although I've never utilized it in my code.
This project is different because I
attempted to use classes in my program.
I _could have_ disemployed classes in this (mini)
project, although I chose not to; for I wanted
to further develop my programming technique.
After all, Python _is_ object-oriented!
